Todo App README

1) I tried my best to get it to pixel perfection but I think my browser renders 
   the font differently so there are tiny discrepancies when I performed blink comparison
2) The modal form only shows up if "Item 1" is clicked. Other items will not show it
3) For the hamburger icon part, I felt like my way of doing it was kinda of a hack, but 
   it works except for one small issue. When it is clicked, it leaves a blue border around
   it. I have not been able to figure out a way to get rid of it.
